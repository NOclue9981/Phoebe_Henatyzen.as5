Demonstration of using session arrays in PHP to store and present data across multiple pages. Website should work if the contents are unzipped into your own XAMPP htdocs folder. 

The first page should present a form and inputs that request the user enter their first name, last name, birthday.  When the user clicks on the "next" button the next page should load.
The second page should present a form and inputs tha request the user enter their country, province/state, city, address and phone number.  When the user clicks on the "next" button the next page should load.
The third page should present a form that requests the user enter information about the health care related issue.  When the user clicks on the "next" button the next page should load.
The fourth page should present a form that requests the user enter more information about the health care related issue.  When the user clicks on the "next" button the next page should load.
The fifth page should present a summary of all the information that was entered, i.e. what value was entered for each requested input.  When the users clicks on a "complete" button the final page should load.
The final page should simply present the text "Thank you for completing the survey."
